<!-- Task 1 - Check if a number is odd or even-->
<!-- In task_1.py, first we take num as interger input from user and then using if statement we put condition that is ndivides by 2 remainder is 0 only then num number is even
else the num number will odd  -->


<!-- Task 2 - Find sum of numbers from 1 to 50 -->
<!-- In task_2.py, first we make a variable n=50 and using for loop we set range of i (0,50) and in every loop value of i in incremented by i=i+1 and i isb added to n i.e, n+i this loop will end when i==50.
In this way n becomes n= 50+1+2+3+4+5+6..........+49 and we get sum of numbers from 1 to 50 -->
